When you have the Roxen module "flickr.pike" loaded put all these files in a 
directory in Roxen CMS. The example will show Photosets of the authenticated
Flickr user. In common.xsl there's also an example of how to list the most
recent public photos.

No paths should need to be altered in the example.
